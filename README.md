# Fish Image Classification with CNN & Pretrained Models

This repository contains code for classifying fish images into multiple categories using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and several pretrained models like VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0. The project includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, deployment, and performance comparison.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to classify fish species using deep learning models. It compares the performance of a basic CNN and several pretrained models to identify which architecture performs best for fish image classification.

- **Dataset**: Images labeled into 11 fish categories.
- **Techniques**: Custom CNN, data augmentation, pretrained model fine-tuning (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0).
- **Evaluation**: Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Preprocessing
- Resize images to 224x224
- Random horizontal flips
- Rotation between -15° to 15°
- Random affine transforms
- Normalize using ImageNet mean and std

## Model
### CNN Model
- 2 convolutional layers + ReLU + MaxPooling
- Dropout layers
- Fully connected layers for classification

### Pretrained Models
- VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0
- Custom final layers adapted to 11 classes
```python
vgg16.classifier[6] = nn.Linear(num_features, 11)
```

## Loss and Optimizer
- **Loss**: CrossEntropyLoss
- **Optimizer**: Adam (lr=0.001)

## Training
- Trained for 20 epochs
- Batch size: 32
- Used `train_loader` and `val_loader` for training and validation
- DataLoader with `shuffle=True` for training
- Model checkpointing and saving best `.pth` model

Each pretrained model was trained using:
- `train_loader` for training
- `val_loader` for validation
- Batch size = 32
- Evaluation done on `eval_loader` or `test_loader`
- Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 were computed per model

## Evaluation
Metrics used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
### Model Performance Comparison
| Model         | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|---------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| VGG16         | 85.5%    | 84.0%     | 85.0%  | 84.5%    |
| ResNet50      | 87.2%    | 86.5%     | 87.0%  | 86.7%    |
| MobileNet     | 89.0%    | 88.0%     | 89.2%  | 88.6%    |
| InceptionV3   | 90.3%    | 89.5%     | 90.0%  | 89.7%    |
| EfficientNetB0| 91.1%    | 90.5%     | 91.2%  | 90.9%    |
